Server instructions:

To make, run 'make'

To run, run './550server <ip address> <port>'
e.g. './550server 127.0.0.1 9000'

To test, run telnet in a separate terminal and connect to the ip and port that was used to start the server, enter the absolute (or relative to 550server) path to the file and hit enter to send the query. The server will return the content of the file.
