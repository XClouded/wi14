1) The sapphire library is an Eclipse project. Just import sapphire-1.0/sapphire in Eclipse 
2) Each of the example applications in the example_apps folder is an Eclipse project.

3) Set the SAPPHIRE_HOME environment variable
4) Configure $SAPPHIRE_HOME/deployment/config.json
5) Run $SAPPHIRE_HOME/deployment/install.py
6) Run $SAPPHIRE_HOME/deployment/deploy.py

Notes:
- When running on the smartphones or tablets, need to include sapphire.jar, and
the jars found in $SAPPHIRE_HOME/libs/
- Generate stubs with the scripts in $SAPPHIRE_HOME/generators. To switch between apps
you need to modify the imports in generate_app_stubs.py
- To switch to deployment of another app, modify $SAPPHIRE_HOME/deployment/deploy.py
- harmony_rmi.jar is patched to work with Android 4.2
